- **Why**: Catches major moves while managing risk

### Volume Confirmation Strategy

## Signal Strength Weighting

Each indicator is assigned a weight based on:
1. **Market Conditions**: Some indicators work better in trending vs ranging markets
2. **Timeframe**: Longer timeframes get higher weights for stability
3. **Historical Performance**: Backtested results influence weighting
4. **Correlation**: Uncorrelated indicators get higher individual weights

## Risk Considerations

- **Lagging Nature**: Most indicators are lagging, use with forward-looking analysis
- **False Signals**: No indicator is 100% accurate, always use multiple confirmations
- **Market Conditions**: Indicators perform differently in different market phases
- **Overfitting**: Too many indicators can lead to analysis paralysis

This combination provides a robust foundation for algorithmic trading while maintaining interpretability for AI analysis.
